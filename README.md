Summary:

This Malloy file takes data from the Data Liberation Project and uses code to create tables and graphs to help visualize what is happening in the data.

What is the data?

The data chosen for this project involves hazmat transportation incident reports filed from the past 55 years. This data includes relevant information the submitter of the form has included in their report such as:

-When the incident occured

-Where the incident occured

-Mode of transportation (train rail, highway, etc.)

-Carrier information

-Short and long name of the commodity that was spilled/destroyed

-Packaging type holding commodity

-Safety metrics of incident (toxicity level, whether it is safe to inhale, etc.)

-Code and description of what failed (caused the incident)

With this information (and more provided in the dataset), I have constructed various visuals to help readers better understand what the data is telling us.
